Lite Version of A Dog Said... with only limbs.
Adds basic animal surgeries and bionics to Rimworld 
This mod is fully compatible with Expanded Prosthetics and Organ Engineering (EPOE)

Following parts are added to the game:

* simple prosthetic/bionic animal arms. Fits monkey and megatherium.
* peglegs. Can be crafted with 1 wood. Fits all animals. Least efficiency.
* simple prosthetic/bionic animal legs. Fits all animals.


All parts can be obtained from traders, except pegleg.
All parts can be crafted at the machining table. Crafting requires a skill of 5-10, depending on part.

Simple parts are slightly lower in efficiency than natural parts. Bionic parts are higher.

Simple/ bionic legs and arms do melee damage now, depending on type.

All parts need medicine skill now to be installed. Simple parts need a skill from 4-6. Bionic parts need a skill form 8-10.
