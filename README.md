This mod is *fully compatible* with **Expanded Prosthetics and Organ Engineering**

Following parts are added to the game:

* simple prosthetic/bionic animal arms. Fits monkey and megatherium.
* peglegs. Can be crafted with 1 wood. Fits all animals. Least efficiency.
* simple prosthetic/bionic animal legs. Fits all animals.
* simple prosthetic tail. Fits all animals with tails.

All parts can be obtained from traders, except peglegs.
All parts can be crafted at the animal prosthetics bench. Crafting requires a skill of 5-12, depending on part.

Simple parts are slightly lower in efficiency than natural parts. Bionic parts are higher.

Simple/ bionic legs, arms do melee damage now, depending on type.
